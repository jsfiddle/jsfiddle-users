After creating a fiddle plese click on the **Remote Button** (as displayed on 
the image on the right). A hashtag with the id for remote debugging will be 
created. Further instructions will be displayed in the 
:ref:`result-without-save`. 

Please load the result on a remote device (mobile, touchpad, client's browser) 
and click on the debugger link. This will provide a Web Inspector like page
with access to the result displayed on the remote browser.
