Welcome to jsFiddle's documentation
===================================

`JsFiddle <http://jsfiddle.net>`_ *is a playground for web developers, a 
tool which may be used in many ways. One can use it as an online editor 
for snippets build from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The code can then be 
shared with others, embedded on a blog, etc. Using this approach, JavaScript 
developers can very easily isolate bugs. We aim to support all actively 
developed frameworks - it helps with testing compatibility.* `(full
